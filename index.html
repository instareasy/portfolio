                <p>Hi. My name is Yarosky Cruz. I’m originally from Puerto Rico, but been living in Central Florida for
                    almost a decade now.</p>

                <p>I’ve been tinkering with HTML and CSS at least since getting my first computer back in the mid to
                    late 90's.
                    In 2017 I finished my degree in Interactive Design. I've built enough small projects and taught
                    myself enough HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I can easily fullfill the role of a Web Designer or
                    Front End
                    Developer. Even though my background is in Design, my main focus at the moment is Web Development.
                    I’m currently doing the UCF Coding BootCamp where I'm hoping on getting bigger projects under my
                    belt and expand my knowledge of Web Development</p>
                <p>When I’m not slinging code you can find me hanging out with my beautiful girlfriend and my dog
                    Oliver.</p>
